                   <p>Leveraged a series of APIs in concert to bring the idea to life. Upon taking a photo on the cellphone, the artwork is identified by Google Vision API. The output of Google Vision is passed to MediaWiki API which returns the artist, year, medium, description, museum, etc. of the artwork and is presented to the user. The museum from MediaWiki is passed to Google's Geolocation API which returns its latitude and longitude coordinates, so a marker can be placed at that point in a React Native Map. This was all persisted on a MongoDB database. Additionally, user login is handled by Facebook OAuth 2.0, Twitter Oauth, or by traditional means. Each user has their own saved gallery of artworks they've photographed, complete with their details as demonstrated above, a map with each of the artworks locations, and a score incremented when they've taken a picture</p>

Multiple users can register accounts, log in, and create or contribute to documents with any changes being successfully persisted. Material UI buttons are used to trigger changes in document editing/style. Draft.js is used to handle the rich text formatting, such as the ability to adjust alignment and change color, font, style, size, and so on. These details are stored in a MongoDB database so they can be successfully retrieved and editing can be resumed at a later time. Documents have a unique ID and link so that users can share them and authors can grant or remove editing privileges. Lastly, version history is maintained, so any saved version of the documented can be revisited and edited.</p>

                   <p>Two social media websites built for an experiment for a researcher writing her dissertation exploring social media behavior. Both versions contained the ability to add friends, make posts with text, images, or videos, profile pages for each user, a home page showing any recent posts by friends, several customizable options, and an adminstrator page for the client to monitor. One website was made specifically for tech-illiterate users and emphasized ease of use, clear navigation, and also accessibility. It had enhanced magnification features, speech to text input, and a painfully obvious flow. The second site was made for younger, tech-savvy individuals and had all the polished UI with all the bells and whistles and functionality of most current social media websites, as well as advertisements.</p>

Next, the pick up game will be broadcasted for all users to see and join! Alternatively, instead of creating a game, simply tap to view the map full of games around you! Games can can be sorted by sport and their start times are displayed so you can easily decide which one to join.

It has the ability to schedule meetings at a certain time between different people, issue reminders, and list calendar items.

The input given to the bot is generally through a chat, as is with most Slack bots and support for buttons in response to the bots, such as for a poll, was implemented.
